The Courtenay River features a naturally cleared estuary at its mouth.</pub:PHYSICAL_DESCRIPTION><pub:HERITAGE_VALUE>The Courtenay River is significant for its historic, scientific, and social value, particularly for its historic importance to Courtenay’s early inhabitants and businesses, its biological importance, its unique physical characteristics, and its role in Courtenay’s recreational development. The heritage value of the Courtenay River lies in its cultural and historical importance to both the Pentlach and K’omoks First Nation’s people who occupied and controlled the territory in and around Courtenay for thousands of years. The remnants of numerous fish traps located throughout the mouth of the Courtenay River and Estuary, one of the largest concentration of inter-tidal fishing structures in North America, attest to the abundance of marine life made available by the Courtenay River and Estuary. The remnants of these aboriginal fish traps are valued as a unique educational opportunity to study sustainable First Nations fishing technologies and culture for all citizens.      The Courtenay River is valued for its important role in Courtenay’s early pioneering development.  Thousands of years of natural flooding of the River resulted in cleared and rich alluvial soil which made conditions perfect for agricultural settlement and prompted Courtenay’s first settlers to preempt in the area in 1862. The width and depth of the river facilitated early transportation and business ventures, which is reflected in the pilings and cribbing that still line the River and estuary.   The Courtenay River’s scientific value lies in its biological importance to a variety of species of wildlife, including salmon and migratory birds that winter in the area. It is significant that hundreds of protected Trumpeter Swans winter at the Courtenay River estuary, resulting in the largest concentration of the species anywhere in the world.The River’s scientific value is also expressed in its physical uniqueness as the River is the shortest navigable river in the world.    The Courtenay River’s social value lies in its central role in the development of Courtenay’s recreational identity which is exemplified by the River’s prominent and accessible location through the heart of the City.Source: City of Courtenay Planning Department</pub:HERITAGE_VALUE><pub:DEFINING_ELEMENTS>Key elements which define the heritage character of the Courtenay River include its:

It is significant that the construction of the church was a community effort and was built by several pioneer Presbyterian families on donated land.Architecturally, St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church is valued as an exceptional example of early local building construction, evidenced by the use of indigenous building materials which were processed on the site. The church’s simple symmetry and modest detail and style demonstrate the practicality of Courtenay’s earliest Presbyterian pioneers.St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church is important aesthetically because it contains an impressive stand of mature Garry oak trees and a cemetery which has been used since the inception of the church. It is significant that the church and cemetery grounds are situated in a predominantly urban and commercial area, and provide a tangible reminder of the contribution of Courtenay’s earliest Presbyterian pioneers to the development of faith in Courtenay and surrounding area.Source: City of Courtenay Planning Department</pub:HERITAGE_VALUE><pub:DEFINING_ELEMENTS>Key elements which define the heritage character of St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Sandwick, include its:Siting

The two-lane street encompasses both residential and commercial uses in distinct districts; the  commercial downtown consists of one or two-storey businesses along a pedestrian street while the residential consists of modest homes immediately adjacent to the sidewalk. The historic place consists of the length of the streetscape and its component built and landscape features.</pub:PHYSICAL_DESCRIPTION><pub:HERITAGE_VALUE>Fifth Street is valued for its historical, cultural and aesthetic significance, particularly as part of the early organization of the City of Courtenay, its early and ongoing connection between the Courtenay River and Comox Lake via the Lake Trail Road, and its vestiges of an untouched commercial main street in a small British Columbia town.The heritage value of Fifth Street lies in its historical association with leading Courtenay pioneers of the late 19th century, particularly Joseph McPhee, who was the visionary behind the original subdivision, and its historically central role in the commercial culture of the city. It is important as an identified constituent of the very earliest conception of the City of Courtenay, being part of the original townsite and noted as Union Street on the town's first survey by George F. Drabble in 1892. This early subdivision paved the way for the establishment of Courtenay's commercial core, which thrived after the opening of the Cumberland mines beginning in 1888, and the arrival of businesses which established Courtenay as the service and commercial centre for the resource-dependent Comox Valley.The street is important for connecting key aspects of the city. In the late 1800s, the bridge over the river at its northern end was a key connection point to sawmills and other industries to the north. The street connects the commercial heart of the city in its central blocks to houses further south and the Lake Trail Middle School property before continuing southward to join Lake Trail Road. Also important is the visual connection southward to the Comox Glacier, a reminder of the closeness of the natural heritage of the area and which contributes to the character of the street. The change in character and land use between the main street commercial and modest residential portions of the street are a valuable reminder of the continuing expansion of Courtenay as its population grew.Fifth Street is important for its early and ongoing role as the commercial centre of town, seen in its early establishment as a service centre for adjoining mining settlements, such as Union Bay and Comox, and through the development of a variety of businesess over its history catering to the needs of worker, citizen and visitor alike. It is important for its social role as Courtenay's ceremonial route, as the city's embodiment of the "main street" in small towns throughout North America, and for having withstood the vagaries of the economy and the growing dominance of the automobile in Courtenay beginning in the 1930s and 40s.Fifth Street is important for its aesthetic values, seen less in the individual buildings and structures than in the overall effect of its physical characteristics, combined with the intangible values of community life and social use of the street. The low profile buildings, boutique stores, open air shopping, the intimate relationship of street, sidwalk and storefronts, and 1950s feel combine to cement the particular character of this rare, viable, surviving main street in a small British Columbia town.Source: City of Courtenay Planning Department</pub:HERITAGE_VALUE><pub:DEFINING_ELEMENTS>Key elements which define the heritage character of Fifth Street include its:Siting
- retention of original survey pattern and lot layout
- north-south alignment with a gentle graded slope down to the river

From 1942 to 1944, the Courtenay River Slough was used to moor the several assault craft used in Combined Operations training and was only one of two sites of its kind in Canada. Currently used as a government dock, the Courtenay Slough reflects the presence of the federal government in the City.Simms Millennium Park has an historical relationship with two noteworthy businesses that occupied the site, including Inkster's Lumber, which operated from 1939 to 1975, and the Brackman and Kerr Milling Company, which operated on the site from 1917 to 1958. Both businesses were situated facing the Courtenay River, highlighting the importance of the river as a transportation corridor for Courtenay’s economy.Simms Millennium Park is associated with Charles Simms, the initial owner of the majority of the current park property.  Simms, a prominent watchmaker, jeweller and local businessman, operated a high-traffic wharf on the site and was actively involved in civic affairs, serving three terms as Courtenay mayor between 1921 and 1942.Flanked on two sides of water, Simms Millennium Park scientific value lies in its situation in a riparian zone. The grouping of mature trees, shrubbery, grasses and water around the park provide an immensely important habitat to a variety of wildlife, ranging from numerous species of salmon that spawn in the area, to birds and small mammals. It is significant that the park is uniquely configured to minimize the impact on this sensitive area, while enabling the public to view the wildlife that reside in their natural surroundings.The aesthetic value of Simms Millennium Park lies in its exceptional design and setting. Constructed as a promenade park, it features a network of trails which provide views of the Courtenay River and slough. It is notable that the park consists of heavily forested areas, and features a variety of mature and recently planted deciduous and conifer trees. The park is important for its educational value seen in the unique and interactive paleo-garden designed by local paleontologists, and which features a variety of prehistoric plant species and fossils.  The social value of Simms Millennium Park is vested in its on-going use as a highly accessible community park and is valued as a cornerstone of the City of Courtenay’s Park program.Source: City of Courtenay Planning Department</pub:HERITAGE_VALUE><pub:DEFINING_ELEMENTS>Key elements which define the heritage character of Simms Millennium Park include its:

In 1918, the first garage on the site was opened by Willemar and Wain as the creation of new roads prompted the need for service stations. Dick Seale and Joe Thomson opened a second garage on the site in 1948, which was heralded as a unique and modern building that was highly equipped to service an increasing influx of automobiles in Courtenay, a reflection of the rapid growth of the city after the Second World War.The aesthetic value of the Seale and Thomson building lies in its Art Deco architecture and prominent setting. Constructed in 1948, the Seale and Thomson Garage reflects the values of modernity and efficiency inherent in an optimistic post World War Two era, seen in the sweeping curved façades and use of glass bricks. The building’s horizontal banding and parapet emphasizes ‘speed and movement’ and parallels the modern developments made to the automobile in the 1940’s.Source: City of Courtenay Planning Department</pub:HERITAGE_VALUE><pub:DEFINING_ELEMENTS>Key elements which define the heritage character of Seale and Thomson Garage include its:Site and Setting

The federal government presence was also reflected in the other federal functions in the building, initially a telegraph and customs office, and in the 1950s, a Veterans Land Act office, Fisheries office, and unemployment office in the second storey addition. It was important to the growth and importance of Courtenay’s downtown when the Post Office moved from the McPhee Block on Fifth Street, below the bridge, to this imposing masonry structure.The building has aesthetic values related to its massing, imposing structure and use of materials, a mix of brick and concrete masonry. The design has elements of both classical and art deco architecture, and the massing, like many government buildings, reflects the importance of its original function. Located on donated land, the building was built of brick from Alberta and Victoria, and used lumber from local sawmills. Despite earthquake damage in 1946 and additions in the 1950s, the building remains a significant landmark in downtown Courtenay.The building is significant for its appropriate adaptive re-use as the Courtenay and District Museum, which celebrates the natural and cultural heritage of the Comox Valley. The building and its use is valued by the community as a heritage building used to its fullest, a scientific, social and historic gathering place and resource centre for residents and visitors alike.Source: City of Courtenay Planning Department</pub:HERITAGE_VALUE><pub:DEFINING_ELEMENTS>Key elements which define the heritage character of the Courtenay and District Museum include its:Siting

The park is naturally bounded by the Courtenay, Puntledge and Tsolum Rivers and features several mature trees, open play fields, trails, tennis courts, skateboard park and four notable buildings.</pub:PHYSICAL_DESCRIPTION><pub:HERITAGE_VALUE>The significance of Lewis Park lies in its historic, aesthetic, spiritual and social values, particularly for the site's historic uses, exceptional design, link to the Comox Valley's First Nations people and its on-going use as a community park.The historic value of Lewis Park is associated with its link to Courtenay's early agricultural roots. From 1893 to 1957 the grounds were used for the annual Fall Fair, an important legacy that continues today. The park is valued for its association with Courtenay's role in World War Two, when the park served as temporary barracks for the 'Fisherman's Reserve', who were the crews of the Assault Craft which were moored at the Courtenay River Slough. The site was one of only two areas in Canada used for combined operations training and played a key role in the preparation for the defense of the west coast of Vancouver Island and future operations in Europe.The spiritual value of Lewis Park is exemplified in the park's two totem poles, which stand prominently at the park entrance, serving to grant peace to those who enter. A series of three totem poles have been erected here, the first placed in 1928, purchased from Chief Joe Wallace of the Greenpoint Rapids reserve. These were replaced in 1956 by two new poles carved by internationally-renowned aboriginal artist Mungo Martin and raised in a traditional ceremony by K'omoks Chief Andy Frank. The third pair of poles were placed in 2002, carved by Calvin Hunt, Mungo Martin's step-grandson. These totems remain an important link to the area's First Nations people.Lewis Park is also valued for its picturesque setting and exceptional design. The park is uniquely configured to facilitate views of the Courtenay, Puntledge and Tsolum Rivers, which border the property. Initially owned by the Lewis family, the site was acquired by the City of Courtenay in 1928. Designed as a recreational park, the site featured open playfields park and a perimeter trail which maximized picturesque views of the Courtenay, Puntledge and Tsolum Rivers. Mature trees, including species of Sitka Spruce, Big-Leaf and Japanese Maples, Cyprus, Cedar and Silver-Leafed Poplar greatly add to the natural beauty of the historic place.   There are two historically significant buildings within the park grounds, including the Lewis Center building situated on the former site of the Comox District's Agricultural Hall, which was the hub of social activity in Courtenay and area for over half a century.  The Courtenay and District Memorial Pool, built in 1949, is an important landmark which serves as a memorial to the military Service Personnel who gave their lives in World War Two.  Actively used for a variety of sporting and leisure activities over a period of 80 years, Lewis Park is a prominent City landmark which reflects the importance of recreation to the social development of the community.Source: City of Courtenay Planning Department</pub:HERITAGE_VALUE><pub:DEFINING_ELEMENTS>Key elements which define the heritage character of Lewis Park include its:

The residence consists of mature landscaping including trees, shrubbery and a shed, and was uniquely constructed with the front elevation perpendicular to the street, maximizing frontage on the Puntledge River, which runs adjacent to the property.</pub:PHYSICAL_DESCRIPTION><pub:HERITAGE_VALUE>The Billy Booth House is significant for its historic and aesthetic value, particularly for its association with Billy Booth and its setting in the Old Orchard neighbourhood.Constructed in 1912, the Billy Booth House is valued for its association with William Booth, who was a prominent figure in Courtenay’s early business and civic affairs. Billy Booth and family operated a highly successful grocery business on the corner of 5th Street and Cliffe Avenue and, in 1923, Booth served on Courtenay City Council, where he contributed to Courtenay’s early economic and civic development.The Billy Booth house is valued as one of the earliest homes constructed in the Old Orchard neighbourhood, Courtenay’s first residential subdivision, and is representative of the ongoing expansion of the city during an era of prosperity. The house is a good local example of Edwardian architecture, seen in its rectangular massing, asymmetrical façade, front entrance featuring a decorated large raised verandah with central door and multi-gabled roof.The aesthetic value of the Billy Booth House is related to the configuration of the house, which is oriented to the side yard, facilitating magnificent views of the Puntledge River and is encompassed by noteworthy mature landscaping which features distinct shrubbery, several species of mature trees and a shed that is sympathetic to the architectural character of the residence. The house was constructed in a time when Courtenay was becoming the service centre for the Comox Valley, and is valued as one of the earliest homes constructed in the Old Orchard neighbourhood, Courtenay’s first residential sub-division. The house remains a significant residential landmark in the community.Source: City of Courtenay Planning Department</pub:HERITAGE_VALUE><pub:DEFINING_ELEMENTS>Key elements which define the heritage character of the Billy Booth House include its:Site and Setting

The area is approximately 115 hectares in size and features over a hundred Garry oak trees as well as numerous species of mature trees and vegetation.</pub:PHYSICAL_DESCRIPTION><pub:HERITAGE_VALUE>The Tsolum River Valley Garry Oak Ecosystem is significant for its biological, cultural and aesthetic value, particular for its uniqueness, its ability to impart knowledge, its association with the area's First Nations people, and the mature nature of the several species of trees, vegetation and shrubbery found in the area. The biological value of the Tsolum River Valley Garry Oak Ecosystem lies in its location as the most northern Garry oak ecosystem in Canada. Many of the trees are found on deep, moist soils, a contrast to most Garry oak ecosystems which are typically found on shallow, dry, or rocky sites. Also of significance are the varieties of trees that are found within the ecosystem, including Sitka spruce, grand fir, Douglas-fir, bigleaf maple, and bitter cherry, making this particular stand one of the last remaining woodland oak communities in Canada. The cultural and social value of the Tsolum River Valley Garry Oak Ecosystem is linked to its association with Comox Valley's First Nations people, a cultural history that includes archaeological sites and written or verbal knowledge indicating a long history of First Nations use in the area. It is an example of a cultural ecosystem which was sustained by First Nations using fire to maintain oaks and open meadows. First Nations use of the area occurred for at least 5000 years. It is also notable that the rarity of this Garry oak ecosystem, coupled with the area's close proximity to a large high school, highlights the potential for this ecosystem to present learning opportunities to a large student population as well as neighbouring residents, naturalists, scientists and all citizens. It also presents opportunities for students to learn restoration techniques and stewardship practices.The oaks and their open meadows and associated vegetation are also distinct from most conifer-dominated native forest, and are a valuable aesthetic feature in Courtenay. The aesthetic value of the Tsolum River Valley Garry Oak Ecosystem is also exemplified by its prominent setting which serves as a transition space between the burgeoning residential growth to the west of the Tsolum River Valley and the predominantly agricultural areas to the east. The mature nature of the Garry oak trees, which are between 80 and 200 years of age, coupled with the presence of other types of species of trees and vegetation greatly add to the aesthetic character of this historic place.Source: City of Courtenay Planning Department</pub:HERITAGE_VALUE><pub:DEFINING_ELEMENTS>Key elements which define the heritage character of the Tsolum River Valley Garry Oak Ecosystem include its:

The house features notable landscaping which includes several mature trees and a decorative gazebo.</pub:PHYSICAL_DESCRIPTION><pub:HERITAGE_VALUE>Sandwick Manor is significant for its historic and aesthetic value, particularly for its association with the initial occupants of the house, its architecture, and its setting.The primary value of Sandwick Manor lies in its association with Eric Duncan (1858-1944), who constructed this substantial residence for his wife Anna in 1910-1911, making it the oldest residential structure east of the Courtenay River. A respected farmer, store owner, and post master, Eric Duncan was perhaps most renowned for his poetry and writings, and whose recollections and memoirs have helped tell the story of Courtenay’s early history. Regarded as the 'philosopher of Vancouver Island,' Duncan was known for his columns about life on Vancouver Island, which appeared in both the Vancouver Province and Sun, as well as local newspapers. It is significant that Duncan was the author of two influential recollections, including 'Fifty-Seven Years in the Comox Valley' and 'Shetland to Vancouver Island', a book which received praise from the London Times and was re-published several times.Sandwick Manor is a good local example of Edwardian-era architecture, seen in its overall building form and in the extensive use of faux stone, as well as in decorative flourishes such as elaborate gingerbread scrollwork under the central projecting gable and horizontal banding. While Sandwick Manor features utilitarian influences, including the concrete bricks from Vancouver and use of timber milled on site, no expense was spared in the construction of the house which is highlighted by the manor’s slate roof derived from Duncan’s native Scotland.Situated in a predominantly commercial area, the manor is a prominent landmark which evokes a time when the house was a family home in a sparsely-populated agricultural district. Sandwick Manor is additionally valued for its notable landscaped elements, including manicured gardens, several species of mature fruit trees dating from the 1920’s, shrubbery, substantial evergreen hedges bordering the property, and a decorative gazebo that is sympathetically designed with the architectural character of the manor.Source: City of Courtenay Planning Department</pub:HERITAGE_VALUE><pub:DEFINING_ELEMENTS>Key elements which define the heritage character of Sandwick Manor include its:Siting

The site includes landscaping, which features mature trees and shrubbery, and an historic Anglican cemetery at the rear of the church.</pub:PHYSICAL_DESCRIPTION><pub:HERITAGE_VALUE>The significance of St. Andrew's Anglican Church lies in its historic and aesthetic value, particularly for its age, its association with the establishment of the Anglican faith in the Courtenay area, its association with the church’s first minister, and its unique architecture.Built in 1877, St. Andrew’s Anglican Church is valued as one of the oldest buildings in Courtenay and is a symbol of the establishment of the Anglican faith in the area. The church, situated on its original historic site, was constructed by devout Anglican followers after their previous place of worship, a modest log cabin church shared with Presbyterians from 1864-1874, was deemed by the Anglican congregation as too small for the growing population of pioneers, reflecting the early expansion of the area’s population generally during the 1870s.  St. Andrew’s Anglican Church also has a historic relationship with Reverend Jules Xavier Willemar, (1842-1935) Courtenay’s first resident clergyman, who ultimately had a profound impact on the religious and social development of the Courtenay area by serving as minister for a span of 42 years. St. Andrew’s Anglican Church is architecturally significant for its blend of Gothic Revival style and local building materials. While the Gothic style, reflected by its stained glass windows, rectangular massing, pointed-arched windows and tower, is typical of many Gothic Revival churches in North America, the church blends them with regional influences, such as the use of locally-milled timber in its construction, and for the pews and pulpit. It is also significant that the church’s stained glass windows, obtained by Willemar from an Anglican church in Alberni and church bell salvaged from a wrecked Australian ship, symbolize the practical nature of Courtenay's earliest Anglican pioneers.Source: City of Courtenay Planning Department</pub:HERITAGE_VALUE><pub:DEFINING_ELEMENTS>Key elements which define the heritage character of St. Andrew's Anglican Church include its:Site and Setting

The property is located off Headquarters Road and is bounded by the Tsolum River to the south of the property and Dove Creek Road to the West. The site features several open fields, forested areas with trails, access to the Tsolum River, an equestrian area and a curling rink.</pub:PHYSICAL_DESCRIPTION><pub:HERITAGE_VALUE>The Comox Valley Exhibition Grounds is significant for its historic, scientific, aesthetic and social value, particularly for its association with the Piercy family, its situation in an historic floodplain and riparian area, and its ongoing use as community agricultural fairgrounds.The historic value of the Exhibition Grounds lies in its association with Piercy Family, a prominent pioneer family who initially established and operated a substantial 165 acre farming operation on the site until the land was purchased by the Canadian government in 1941. The property represents an important connection to the Comox Valley’s agricultural history. The Exhibition Grounds site is important scientifically for its location in an historical floodplain and riparian area. The open spatial qualities of the Exhibition Grounds, coupled with the proximity of the Tsolum River which borders the property, highlight the legacy and importance of the area’s natural flood patterns. Recurrent flooding depositied the alluvial soil which provided the impetus for the agricultural settlement of the area when the first pioneers of the Comox Valley arrived in 1862. Bounded by the Tsolum River at the south end of the property, the site features a riparian area which consists of mature coniferous and deciduous trees and native vegetation. This area provides habitat for a variety of wildlife, including species of salmon, which have recently been re-introduced into the Tsolum River.The aesthetic value of the Exhibition Grounds lies in its open spatial qualities and forested areas, which feature several mature species of deciduous and coniferous trees, and a series of trails which have views of the Tsolum River.The social value of the Exhibition Grounds is reflected in the variety of annual events held on the grounds. One of these is the Comox Valley Fall Fair, which has been held for over a century and reflects the importance of agriculture to the social and economic development of the Comox Valley. Also of social significance are the equestrian centre and curling rink, which serve to demonstrate the recreational values held by the community.Source: City of Courtenay Planning Department</pub:HERITAGE_VALUE><pub:DEFINING_ELEMENTS>Key elements which define the heritage character of the Comox Valley Exhibition Grounds include its:
